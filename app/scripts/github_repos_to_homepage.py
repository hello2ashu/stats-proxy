github_repos_to_homepage.py

Fetches a GitHub user's (or org's) repositories and writes them into a
gethomepage.dev `services.yaml` file as a group of bookmarks, one entry
per repo. Designed to be run on a schedule (cron) so the dashboard stays
in sync with your GitHub account automatically.

It only touches the ONE group you point it at (--group). Every other
group in services.yaml is left completely untouched, formatting and
comments included (it uses ruamel.yaml round-trip mode).

USAGE
-----
    python3 github_repos_to_homepage.py \\
        --user hello2ashu \\
        --config /path/to/services.yaml \\
        --group "GitHub Repos" \\
        --token "$GITHUB_TOKEN" \\
        --show-total

    # dry run - print the YAML that WOULD be written, don't touch the file
    python3 github_repos_to_homepage.py --user hello2ashu --dry-run

FIRST TIME SETUP
----------------
    pip install requests ruamel.yaml

A GitHub token is optional for public repos but strongly recommended:
unauthenticated requests are capped at 60/hour per IP, which is easy to
hit if the script runs on a cron and you also browse the API elsewhere.
A token bumps that to 5,000/hour. A classic token with no scopes checked
(public read-only) is enough for public repos; add `repo` scope if you
want private repos included too (and pass --include-private).

VISIBILITY (private vs. public)
--------------------------------
Every entry gets a small colored-dot prefix in its description showing
whether the repo is private or public, in addition to the deployed
(green)/undeployed (red) status dot: 🟣 = private, 🔵 = public. This is
separate from --include-private, which controls whether private repos are
fetched from the API at all - once fetched, both private and public repos
always show up with the right colored dot. Pass --hide-visibility to turn
the dot off if you'd rather not surface repo visibility on the dashboard.
